; This is a list of interaction objects common to both games. For game-specific definitions, see
; constants/{game}/interactions.s.
;
; An "interaction" is simply a type of object. The most notable quality of this type of object is
; that they can be assigned scripts (see the "scripts/" folder). This makes them well-suited to be
; used for implementing NPCs, puzzles, and a lot of other miscellaneous stuff.
;
; The comments here describe the "interface" of the objects; that is, what variables are important
; to initialize when creating them. Additional comments about internal variables used by the objects
; may be found next to their code (search for a label of the form "interactionCodeXX", where XX is
; their ID).
;
; COMMENT FORMAT:
;   LynnaLab parses the comments to glean information about interactions. When a line starts with
;   ";;", every subsequent line that starts with ";" is considered documentation until the next
;   uncommented line. Within here, the description can be typed, or fields can be entered with
;   "@field{value}".
;
;   Field list (case-insensitive):
;   * postype: Affects how to determine the object's position.
;       "normal" = Y and X positions are treated normally (default).
;       "short" = both Y and X positions are stored in Y variable.
;       "none" = this object doesn't have anything resembling a position.
;   * palette: Palette header to load. Most sprites use palettes 0-5, which are always the
;              same, but some object use slots 6-7 for custom palettes. These objects
;              should use this field.
;   * subid_XX: Description for subid XX.
;
;  You might also see some manual newline ("\n") entries sometimes since making the comments pretty
;  in both the GUI and in plaintext format is hard...
