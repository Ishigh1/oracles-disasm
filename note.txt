TODO :
- Idea to have each person do their own floor of hack (can change this later on if you want)
- the next few floors till dungeon 0 is done.
- Make the bridge in room 419 stay destroyed after a screen change
- Maybe add a warp to the entrance after finishing floor 1?


Current progression :
- Floor 2 done (plus a little shop outside the dungeon)
- Floor 1 done (added a new floor below with an empty room where floor 1 ends)

Items used:
- Shovel
- Bombs
- Bombchus
- Power Bracelet
- Shield
- Dungeon Map
- Dungeon Compass
- Keys (x4) on Floor 2
- Keys (x3) on Floor 1
- Seed Satchel
- Mystery Seeds
- Switch Hook L2
- Magnetic Gloves
- Wooden Sword

Possible fixes needed:
-Probably door logic

New stuff:
Using a mystery seed on an armos transforms it into a pushable armos statue
Implemented a "regrowable sand" as INTERAC_MISCELLANEOUS_1, subid 17
Implemented a keydrop if the tile at var03 changes as INTERAC_DUNGEON_STUFF subid 06
Implemented a bridge collapsing event in room 419

Notes:
Floor 2 is basically a no-sword run, defeated enemies with bomb throws, and shovel flipping.
For floor 1 (remove details once that floor is done):
    room 405, 410, 419 and 431 play with ledge jump over several tiles or different screens
    room 411 introduces mystery to transform armos into statues
    room 413 introduces breaking a false statue
    I intended to make a room to combine those concepts together, tile 0x17 is ready to act as a fake statue to be broken
    The use of magnetic gloves on the diamonds is necessary to complete the floor.
