TODO :
- Idea to have each person do their own floor of hack (can change this later on if you want)
- the next few floors till dungeon 0 is done.
- Floor 0 is only half done and ends abruptly in room 415


Current progression :
- Floor 1 done (plus a little shop outside the dungeon)
- Floor 0 half done

Items used:
- Shovel
- Bombs
- Bombchus
- Power Bracelet
- Shield
- Dungeon Map
- Dungeon Compass
- Keys (x4) on Floor 1
- Small key on floor 0
- Seed Satchel
- Mystery Seeds

Possible fixes needed:
None noticed

New stuff:
Using a mystery seed on an armos transforms it into a pushable armos statue
Implemented a "regrowable sand" as INTERAC_MISCELLANEOUS_1, subid 17
Implemented a keydrop if the tile at var03 changes as INTERAC_DUNGEON_STUFF subid 06

Notes:
Floor 1 is basically a no-sword run, defeated enemies with bomb throws, and shovel flipping.
For floor 0 (remove details once that floor is done):
    room 405 and 410 play with ledge jump over several tiles or different screens
    room 411 introduces mystery to transform armos into statues
    room 413 introduces breaking a false statue
    I intended to make a room to combine those concepts together, tile 0x17 is ready to act as a fake statue to be broken
