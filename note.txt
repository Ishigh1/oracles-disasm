TODO :
- Idea to have each person do their own floor of hack (can change this later on if you want)
- the next few floors till dungeon 0 is done.
- Make the bridge in room 419 stay destroyed after a screen change
- Maybe add a warp to the entrance after finishing floor 2?


Current progression :
- Floor 4 done (Slate hunt time)
- Floor 3 done (plus a little shop outside the dungeon)
- Floor 2 done (added a new floor below with an empty room where floor 2 ends)
- Floor 1 done (could use some polishing perhaps)
- Floor 0 done (rewards a sword upgrade)

Items used:
- Shovel
- Bombs
- Bombchus
- Power Bracelet
- Shield
- Dungeon Map
- Dungeon Compass
- Keys (x2) on Floor 4
- Keys (x4) on Floor 3
- Keys (x3) on Floor 2
- Keys (x4) on Floor 1
- Boss Key on Floor 1
- Seed Satchel
- Mystery Seeds
- Switch Hook L2
- Magnetic Gloves
- Wooden Sword
- Flippers
- Keys (x2) on Floor 0*
- Ember Seeds*
- Slingshot*
- Noble Sword*
- Roc's Feather
- Cane of Somaria

Possible fixes needed:
-Probably door logic
-Strange color changing to palette 2 when moving color cube in certain positions*
   -Caused by the Switch Diamond. Would be hard to fix without altering the room layout
-Minecarts don't spawn when returning from Game Over??*
   -Fixed
-D2 boss event when defeated maybe*
-You can get softlocked if you run out of mystery seeds before talking to the Owl Statue from the bottom-most floor
   -Added some pots with Mystery Seed drops

New stuff:
Using a mystery seed on an armos transforms it into a pushable armos statue
Implemented a "regrowable sand" as INTERAC_MISCELLANEOUS_1, subid 17
Implemented a keydrop if the tile at var03 changes as INTERAC_DUNGEON_STUFF subid 06
Implemented a bridge collapsing event in room 419
Implemented an object that resets minecarts, as a fix to the aforementined issue. INTERAC_DUNGEON_STUFF subid 07
Implemented a cutscene with Zelda subid $04
Implemented a trigger that resets some statues' positions (MISC_PUZZLES subid $22)
Implemented an object that turns half of the room into invisible spikes (MISCELANEOUS_2 subid $18)
Owl Statues move to the left if var03 is different than $00
Implemented diagonal walls (tile collision values = $20, $21, $22 or $23)
Programmed a "new" boss, which spawns a "new" enemy (Enemy IDs $65, $6f)

New files:
(I won't say their names because I don't wanna spoil the boss)
2 new spr files in gfx_compressible/ages
4 new .s files in object_code/ages/enemies


Notes:
Floor 3 is basically a no-sword run, defeated enemies with bomb throws, and shovel flipping.
For floor 2 (remove details once that floor is done):
    room 405, 410, 419 and 431 play with ledge jump over several tiles or different screens
    room 411 introduces mystery to transform armos into statues
    room 413 introduces breaking a false statue
    I intended to make a room to combine those concepts together, tile 0x17 is ready to act as a fake statue to be broken
    The use of magnetic gloves on the diamonds is necessary to complete the floor.

Floor 1 uses 2 custom dungeonScripts for dungeon 0:

Since neither Giant Ghini nor Eyesoar Child are used in this hack, their ObjectCollisionTables have been repurposed for the custom enemy and boss.


Current Dungeon 0 scripts (used by INTERAC_DUNGEON_SCRIPT):
$00: standard boss death script
$01: spawns a free-standing small key in room 62f
$02: spawns a chest in room 453 when a button is pressed
$03: spawns a Long Hook
$04: activates Trigger 2 if Triggers 0 and 1 are active (vanilla script from Mermaid's Cave)
$05: moves the camera to focus this object. Used during the cutscene with Zelda
$06: spawns an Owl Statue if Roomflag $20 is not set
$07: custom BossDeath for the custom boss
$08: shows a text 90 frames after entering the room
$09: warps Link out of the dungeon. Used at the end of the game



floor 1 TODO:
add stairs in room 453 to roomSpecificTileSubstitutions

Floor 0 is a kind of challenging run with 3 bosses*
