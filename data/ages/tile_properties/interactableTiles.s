; The following is a table indicating what should happen when Link is standing right in front of a
; tile of a particular type.
;
; Among other things, this determines which blocks are pushable. See also
; data/{game}/tile_properties/pushableTiles.s for more properties of pushable tiles.
;
; Data format:
;
; b0: tile index
; b1:
;    Bits 0-3 (second digit): How to behave when Link is next to this kind of tile.
;        0: Pushable tile
;             bit 7: Set if it's pushable in all directions. Otherwise, bits 4-5 are the direction
;                    it can be pushed in.
;             bit 6: Set if the power bracelet is needed to push it.
;        1: Keyblock
;        2: Key door
;           First digit is 0-3 indicating direction, or 4-7 for boss key doors
;        3: Should show text when pushing against the tile.
;           First digit is an index for which text to show.
;        4: Chest (handle opening)
;        5: Sign (handle reading)
;        6: Overworld keyhole (ie. Yoll Graveyard, Crown Dungeon)
