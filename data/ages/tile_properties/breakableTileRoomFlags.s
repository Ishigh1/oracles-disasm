; This is a list of tiles that will cause certain room flag bits to be set when destroyed.
;
; In order for this to work, the corresponding bit in the "breakableTileModes" table
; must be set; see breakableTiles.s.
;
; Data format:
; b0: tile index
; b1: bit 7:    Set if it's a door/bomb wall linked between two rooms in a dungeon (will update the
;               room flags in both rooms)
;     bit 6:    Set if it's a door/bomb wall linked between two rooms indoors
;     bits 0-3: If bit 6 or 7 is set, this is the "direction" of the room link ($0, $4, $8, or $c).
;               If bits 6 and 7 aren't set, this is the bit to set in the room flags (ie.
;               value of 2 will set bit 2).
